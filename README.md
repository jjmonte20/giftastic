# Welcome to my giftastic web page

Made my page in a comic book style

You can input a superhero to make a button that produces gifs of that superhero

These gifs load as a static image, but when clicked, the gifs will animate, gifs come in 10 at a time and prepend as a list

console logs exists to show the buttons working and produce responses for the gifs collected
